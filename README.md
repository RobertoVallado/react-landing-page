# Think Spanish Simple / Website Replica using React

This is a React-based replica of my original HTML/CSS website.  
It is a fully static site with no backend and no database.  

>We will migrate to teach spanish to anglophones to: Enseigner l'espagnol aux francophones <3 

The site now supports **multiple languages** (English, French, Spanish) using **react-i18next**, and includes a **contact form** powered by **Formspree** with optional **reCAPTCHA** protection.
